# In the Name of ALLAH

### TODO List
- TODO Build an example with the sample code from the Paper
- TODO Continue the paper. Don't waste time here or there. Focus on this Book
- In page 3 of chapter 2 in the book, ask about points: (e) and (f)

### Practical Examples
- TODO Example 1: Included in Chapter Two of the Book
- TODO Example 2: From Nouran's Paper on Evaluation of LMS using Neutrosophic
- TODO Example 3: From Fatma BaMohamed Dissertation / Paper
- TODO Example 4: Students and Learning Outcomes - Your own example in Job recommendation based on skills

### TODO List
#### Updated on Monday 8th of January 2019
#### Based on the following Paper
https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/8/3/84
entitled: Single-Valued Neutrosophic Hybrid Arithmetic and Geometric Aggregation Operators and Their Decision-Making Method

Major Updates will be performed, including
- Make a new class - SVNN: Single Valued Neutrosophic Number - instead of Element
- This class will support extra operations defined at the paper

### Important
- Since a single-valued neutrosophic number is a special case of an interval neutrosophic number,
the concepts and operations of interval neutrosophic numbers can be introduced to single-valued neutrosophic numbers

- Contact the author to ask about precedence of operators
